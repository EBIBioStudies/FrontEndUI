            <h3 class="icon icon-generic" data-icon="i">What is BioStudies?</h3>

            <p class="justify">The goal of the BioStudies database is to provide light-weight means for capturing data
                from biological studies, especially for the cases where due to the pace of high-throughput technology
                development the generated data does not fit into any of the specialized EBI databases, or where
                established technologies are used in combination. The database will be able to accept a wide range
                of types of studies described via a simple format, and will not impose minimum requirements outside
                the respective community agreements. It will also enable manuscript authors to submit supplementary
                information and link to it from the publication.</p>
