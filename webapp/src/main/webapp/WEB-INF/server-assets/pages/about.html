            <h3 class="icon icon-generic" data-icon="i">What is BioStudies?</h3>

            <p class="justify">The BioStudies database holds descriptions of biological studies, links to data from
                these studies in other databases at EMBL-EBI or outside, as well as data that do not fit in the
                structured archives at EMBL-EBI. The database can accept a wide range of types of studies described
                via a simple format. It also enables manuscript authors to submit supplementary information and link
                to it from the publication.</p>
