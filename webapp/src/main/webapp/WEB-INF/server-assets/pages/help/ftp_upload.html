		<h2>Send data files to ArrayExpress by FTP</h2>
	   
		<p>ArrayExpress provides a FTP repository accessible by all submitters to upload a large volume of data files which are associated with their experiment submissions. Raw sequence files from high-throughput sequencing experiments (e.g. fastq.gz or bam files) must be transferred to ArrayExpress via FTP as they are too large to be uploaded via the <a href="/cgi-bin/microarray/magetab.cgi">MAGE-TAB</a> or <a href="/fg/annotare/login">Annotare</a> submission tools.</p>
		<p>FTP upload is also useful if you would like to send files to us prior to a submission (e.g. for us to check if they are in a suitable format).</p>
		
		<p><strong>Before you start transferring files, please note the following points:</strong></p>
		<ol>
		<li>Make sure your file names are unique/specific so you will not be overwriting other submitters' files (or risk your own files being overwritten likewise). E.g. <code>"Bloggs_lab_Mar2014_sample1.fq.gz"</code> is a better choice of file name than simply <code>"sample1.fq.gz"</code>.</li>
		<li>When the transfer is complete, please email us at <a href="mailto:arrayexpress@ebi.ac.uk">arrayexpress@ebi.ac.uk</a> with the names of files transferred.</li>
		<li>All ArrayExpress submitters use the same account to upload files (see below). As most of the files are un-/pre-published, we make all uploaded files "private", which means you will not be able to see any files or directories already on the FTP site, including those that you uploaded or created.</li>
		<li>Data files uploaded to ArrayExpress by FTP only constitute part of an experiment submission. The submission is only complete when experimental <em>meta-data</em> is also submitted to ArrayExpress using either <a href="/cgi-bin/microarray/magetab.cgi">MAGE-TAB</a> or <a href="/fg/annotare/login">Annotare</a> submission tools. See <a href="submissions_overview.html">submissions help page</a> for further details.</li>
		</ol>

        <h3>Transferring files with Windows Explorer (drag and drop)</h3>
        
        <p>Make sure you've opened a Windows Explorer window and <em>not</em> an internet browser window as the latter is not designed for FTP file uploads.</p>
        <p>In the Windows Explorer window, enter <code><strong>ftp://ftp-private.ebi.ac.uk/</strong></code> in the address bar. You will be asked to login. The username is <code><strong>aexpress</strong></code> and password is <code><strong>aexpress1</strong></code>:</p>
        
        <p><img src="ftp_upload_windows_explorer_FTP.png" alt="Windows Explorer FTP login image" style='border:2px solid #385930'></p>

        <p>After logging in, you can drag files from your computer's file system and drop them onto the logged-on Windows Explorer window.</p> 
        <p>Note: you will not be able to see any files or directories on the FTP site, including the files that you have uploaded.</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Transferring files with Mac/Unix/Windows terminal (command prompt)</h3>
        
        <p> Connect to the FTP server using the command <code><strong>ftp ftp-private.ebi.ac.uk</strong></code>. The username is <code><strong>aexpress</strong></code> and password is <code><strong>aexpress1</strong></code>.  Use the <code>put</code> command to place one file (or mput for multiple files) into the default FTP directory.</p>
        <p>To exit FTP, type <code><strong>quit</strong></code>. On exiting you will get a message printed to screen to tell you whether your transfer was successful.</p>
        <p>Note: you will not be able to list the files in the directory or download files from the FTP site to your directory.</p>
