        <a id="general"><h3>1. General information</h3></a>
        <p>Experiments (sets of assays) and array designs in
            ArrayExpress are either 'public' or 'private'. Data
            can be kept private until a specified release date or an associated
            paper containing the experiment or array design accession number is
            published. Access to private data is possible via submitter and
            reviewer login accounts. </p>
        <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" class="linktotop">Top</a></p>
        <a id="release"><h3>2. Release policy</h3></a>
        <p>Experiments are made public when</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the specified release date is reached</li>
            <li>the submitter emails to tell us that the data can now be
                released (usually this is when an associated publication is accepted or
                published)</li>
            <li>we identify a publication in which the ArrayExpress
                experiment accession number is cited</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Array designs are made public when </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the specified release date is reached </li>
            <li>the submitter emails to tell us that the data can now be
                released</li>
            <li>when an experiment the array design is linked to is made
                public</li>
            <li>we identify a publication in which the ArrayExpress array
                design accession number is cited </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When an experiment or array design is made public the data is
            available through the ArrayExpress web interface
            (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) and the FTP site
            (ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/).</p>

        <a id="changes"><h3>3. Release date changes</h3></a>
        <p>Reminders about experiment and array design release dates are
            sent to submitters 30 and 60 days before the current release date.
            Release dates can be changed by emailing us at miamexpress@ebi.ac.uk
            stating the new required release date (YYYY-MM-DD) and the accession
            number of the experiment or array design.</p>

        <a id ="removal"><h3>4. Removal of data from the public domain</h3></a>
        <p>Data may be be made private again in ArrayExpress (removing both web interface and FTP access) in the
            following circumstances</p>
        <ul>
            <li> submitters realise after their experiment or array design
                is made public that they failed to request a change to the release
                date. Note we import data regularly from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">Gene Expression Omnibus
                    (GEO)</a> and any data that GEO notify us as being withdrawn will also be
                withdrawn from ArrayExpress.</li>
            <li>data is found to be incorrect e.g. sample annotation or
                sample-data file associations are wrong. The data will be removed from ArrayExpress until the data can be corrected.</li>
            <li> data are found to have been submitted to ArrayExpress
                without the permission of the rightful owner; this is expected to be
                extremely rare and requires formal institutional contact with the
                submitting institution. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Data is made private again at the next daily update of
            ArrayExpress where possible. As the data will have
            been distributed previously as public, ArrayExpress cannot exercise any
            control on the resultant use of the data by third parties.</p>
        <p>Array designs cannot be made private again if they are linked
            to a public experiment. Array designs will be kept private if they are
            linked only to private experiments.</p>
        <p>Experiments that have been public may be included in the <a href="/gxa">Gene Expression Atlas</a> . If an
            experiment is later made private again in ArrayExpress then it will also be removed from the Atlas.
            However, the Atlas has a monthly, rather daily, release schedule and
            data will be only removed at the next release unless there are
            extenuating circumstances.</p>
        <p>High throughput sequencing read data that is submitted to
            ArrayExpress, but transferred to the European Nucleotide Archive is
            subject to their <a href="/ena/about/data_availability_policy">data release policies</a>.</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" class="linktotop">Top</a></p>
        <a id="user_accounts"><h3>5. ArrayExpress user accounts</h3></a>
        <p>Submitters are sent details about their own user accounts and
            those for journal reviewers after an experiment or array design is
            loaded into the ArrayExpress database. Submitters
            can view all their private experiments and array designs using one
            login. Reviewer accounts only give access to individual experiments or
            array designs. </p>
