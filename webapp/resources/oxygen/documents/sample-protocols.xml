NOTE! 6 x 2ml RNALATER samples were processed using 6 midiprep columns the RNA eluted in 250ul and the samples pooled Extractions were performed in a PCR hood.  2ml Cellular samples were centrifuged (20,000g, 2 mins) and the pellet resuspended in 2ml RLT (+20 ul Beta mercapto ethanol). Following vigourous vortexing (1 min, in 5 second bursts), the samples were spun  (20,000g, 5 mins) and the supernatant transferred to a 15 ml Falcon tube containing 2ml 70% ethanol. Following vigourous mixing the samples were applied to a Qiagen MidiPrep column, centrifuged (3,200g, 5 mins) and the flow-through discarded. Columns were washed twice with 2.5ml RPE buffer (3,200g, 5 mins) and transferred to a new Falcon tube. RNAse free water (250ul) was added, the samples incubated (room temperature, 1 min) and the RNA eluted by centrifugation (3,200g, 5 mins).  Following the elution of RNA, replicate midipreps (6) were combined and the subsequent RNA solutions precipitated. 0.5 volumes of 7.5M NH4Ac and 2 volumes of 100% ethanol was added and the samples incubated at -80oC overnight. Following centrifugation (20,000g, 30 mins), the supernatant was discarded and the pellet washed twice with 0.5ml 70% ethanol (20,000g, 30 mins). The pellet was air dried, resuspended in 50 ul RNAse free water and stored at -80oC.  RNA quantity and quality was assessed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (www.agilent.com)</text><type>N/A</type><hardware/><software/><standardpublicprotocol/><user id="1"/></protocol><protocol><id>232356</id><accession>A-MAXD-2:maxdLoad2.bioinf.man.ac.uk:Wilson:[ImageAnalysisProtocol]EhV Microarray Image Analysis Protocol/0</accession><name>A-MAXD-2:maxdLoad2.bioinf.man.ac.uk:Wilson:[ImageAnalysisProtocol]EhV Microarray Image Analysis Protocol/0</name><text>Title: EhV Microarray Image Analysis Protocol.

Following snap cooling on ice, 12.6 ul of the reaction mix was added to each sample. Reaction mix composed of 5ul 5X first strand buffer, 3ul 0.1M DTT, 0.6ul 25mM dNTP mix (containing no dCTP) and 3ul Cy3- OR Cy5-dCTP (Amersham). Following the addition of 2ul of Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), samples were mixed gently and incubated at 42oC for 2 hours.  Prior to hybridisation, samples were incubated at 70oC for 10 mins with 15ul 0.1M NaOH. 15ul of 0.1M HCl was added to neutralise the reaction.</text><type>N/A</type><hardware/><software/><standardpublicprotocol/><user id="1"/></protocol><protocol><id>232363</id><accession>A-MAXD-2:maxdLoad2.bioinf.man.ac.uk:Wilson:[SamplingProtocol]EHV Growth conditions/0</accession><name>A-MAXD-2:maxdLoad2.bioinf.man.ac.uk:Wilson:[SamplingProtocol]EHV Growth conditions/0</name><text>E. huxleyi cultured in f/2 media (supplemented with nutrients) on a 16:8 hour (light:dark) cycle at 15oC.
